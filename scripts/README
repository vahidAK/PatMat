These scripts are a combination of the standard InvertypeR method (doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07892-9) and the inversion-aware phasing method 
... for StrandPhaseR (doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.20.472354), adapted for the PofO + chromosome-length haplotypes task.
	
To run the scripts, adjust the header of the file "master.sh" (not "master_WCCW_composite.sh" etc.), and then run "bash master.sh" in a directory 
... containing the good-quality Strand-seq libraries for an individual

The scripts were run in the conda environment described in the "env.yml" file, with the addition of the following R packages (for some of these, 
... the specific commit does matter):
